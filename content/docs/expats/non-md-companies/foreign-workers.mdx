## Applicable Passes For Fkw Entrance Into Malaysia

Our Expats Service Centre can only process and approve the following types of passes prior to submittal to the Immigration Department of Malaysia:

### Employment Pass

There are 3 categories of this type of work permit that enables a FKW to take up employment under a contract of service with an organisation in Malaysia. The duration of these permits varies from a minimum of 12 months to a maximum of 60 months depending on the nature of employment and the need of such employment by the hiring organisation.

The Immigration Department of Malaysia will issue the Employment Pass upon the approval of employment positions by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) in Malaysia Digital (MD) Company.

A foreign knowledge worker issued with the Employment Pass shall not, without the consent of Immigration Department of Malaysia, engage in any form of paid employment in any business or professional occupation in Malaysia other than the particular employment specified in the Employment Pass.
